- ### What am I doing?
	- I am figuring out how to structure this graph.
	- I am defining a structure now so that it stays organized as it grows.
	- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
	  Just a few simple rules can turn chaos into order.
	  #+END_QUOTE
		- Rules should be short and simple.
		- Rules should be easy to understand.
- ### Why am I doing it?
	- As stated above, so that it stays organized as it grows.
	- This graph is my public "knowledge garden", so I would like it to be as accessible to others as possible.
- ### What are my rules?
	- Any block larger than one paragraph (subjective) should be its own page.
	- Any page longer than two full screens should be split up.
	- Full sentences should be used when possible.
	- No orphan pages should *ever* be pushed to production.
	- All root pages should have a category.
	- No child pages should have a category.
